# Notes

The [ansible-sempahore](https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore) tool expects the `roles/` directory to be stored in the root of the repository while it expects the `collections/` directory to be stored in the same directory as the playbook it is executing. See [here](https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore/issues/1144#issuecomment-1516953367) for more info.
